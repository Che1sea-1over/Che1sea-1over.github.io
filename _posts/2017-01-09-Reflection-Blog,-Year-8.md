Reflection blog, 9/1/16

Today I learnt that, in the UK, we laugh at people and humiliate them when they do something wrong. I have realised that this ridiculously unfair and wrong. I get an awful, deep-down embarrassment when everyone laughs at something I've done wrong yet I still don’t think twice about giggling at someone else. I will endeavour to encourage my peers instead of humiliating them. I was helped to this realisation by a video showing a boy in Japan failing to get over a vault again and again in front of his classmates and parents. Instead of laughing at him when he failed, his classmates kept cheering words of encouragement. The boy got to the point where he started crying, his classmates run up, gathered round him and showed they were supporting him all the way. Straight after that, he made it and he was filled with incredible joy along with all his supporters. It would be so much better if that was the environment in our school, as everyone would learn together and make stronger relationships. I learned another thing from this video which really interested me. The boy began to weep yet the teacher didn’t let him off, instead he just sent him back until he made it. In my primary school, as soon as we started crying we were let off everything and the teacher claimed that we tried our best and everything was fine. This is not acceptable because it means that the student doesn’t learn to never give up and have strong resilience. 

To conclude I learnt so much in a lesson that really made me think and I enjoyed it thoroughly and will take the lessons I learnt forward with me.
