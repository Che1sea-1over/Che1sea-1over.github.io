    <td>I I learnt by, as usual, completing the task that was set by following the instructions carefully. I found that doing the simple stuff works, by looking at what needs to be done and completing it with minimal thought. This helped me work quickly. I also did not tend to make many errors until I was completely stuck on one task.</td>

    <td>As I was doing it very fast, I realised that I didn't take in what I was reading  and got stuck on one of the more complicated questions. I need to improve by paying more attention to the code so I remember it when it gets harder.</td>
