(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, we completed the 2 exercises we attempted to complete, we skipped one that seemed unhelpful as it was to easy.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Someone in my 3 read out the code whilst another typed it in. Then the person not doing either of those things read the extra bits of information beside the exercises. We made sure we all had equal time doing each thing in order for everyone to extend their understanding and learning.  </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When I was neither using the computer or the code book, I sometimes got a bit distracted and talked to the group next to us. I need to make sure I use my time efficiently. I also need to stop making silly and obvious mistakes in my code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will attempt to set up the Fuze quicker in order to get more coding time which will extend my learning thoroughly.</td>
