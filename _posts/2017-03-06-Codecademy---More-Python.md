    <td>For the majority of this lesson we were completing exercises on Codecademy. Halfway through the lesson we had a class discussion on cheating. I realised that copying may help you at the time but in the longrun it means you aren't learning anything which eventually leaves you behind. I made sure that I read the instructions carefully in order to make the least mistakes that I can. In the future I will make sure that if someone asks me for help, I won’t just give them the answer, instead I’ll give them clues and explain it to them.   </td>
