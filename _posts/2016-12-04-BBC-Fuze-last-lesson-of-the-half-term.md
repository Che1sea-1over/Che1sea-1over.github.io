    <td>Once again, I got distracted by talking to people in and out of my group instead of doing something useful. Also I messed around with the code and put wrong things in on purpose to see what happened, that only wasted time.</td>

    <td>Next time we need to make sure that everyone has equal time coding because in this lesson, I felt like i should’ve had more time doing the code. Also I need to remember to stay focused on the work and not get so easily distracted in order to expand my learning to the fullest.</td>
