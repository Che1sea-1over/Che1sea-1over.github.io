    <td>Next time I will be concentrated, even when I'm not controlling the computer.
I will not get distracted whilst using the computer and try to learn as much as I can from the book and/or other sources.
I want to learn how to change font when producing text.
Take in more information and not just read it and then forget it by the next day.
