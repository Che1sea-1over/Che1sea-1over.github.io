I tried everything within my ability and I was still getting the ERROR message. I finally asked Mr.Keen for help and he explained it to me with every last detail so I now know.</td>

    <td>For the last 2 exercises I had been getting the code wrong but Codecademy was still allowing the wrong code to be passed through to the next exercise. Eventually, the code didn't work and Mr Keen traced the mistake back to an exercise that I had done previously and got totally wrong.</td>
