Codecademy Diary - 19-26 of March 2017.

 

Start: 28%

Target: to finish 5% throughout the week.

Did I reach my target:Yes, I got to 38% completion.

Diary:

Monday: 1 hour lesson in IT, I was stuck so only went from 28% to 29% which was very bad progress. I didn't do any codecademy that night.

Tuesday: 5 minutes to do one exercise in the start of lists and dictionaries, I reached 30% completion.

Wednesday: 15 minutes approx to do some more in lists and dictionaries. I worked efficiently and reached 34% completion.

Thursday: 5 minutes, I completed some more on the long exercise of lists and dictionaries about the big holiday, I managed to reach 36%.

Friday: I didn't do any codecademy.

Saturday: I finished of lists and dictionaries, 38% completion. This diary helped me do more codecademy throughout the week making me more ready for the lesson on Monday.
