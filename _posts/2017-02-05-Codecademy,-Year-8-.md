Codecademy  Blog 1              18/1/17

After having a lesson all about the unfairness of humiliation, we started to do some coding.

We were told to make Codecademy accounts and to start the Python course and try and just complete the exercises, but importantly in however look it took us an without cheating.

I completed a lot of exercises in the lesson and I felt like I had really taken a step up from where I was at the start of the lesson. 

I started the python work course on codecademy. I quickly learnt that the best way to work on the exercises was to take my time because when I rushed I made silly mistakes and missed important pieces of information.

I felt as if I was just doing the exercises as they came and that I wasn't actually remembering and taking in any of the things being taught. I also lost concentration on some occasions which meant that I was losing crucial learning time. Finally, I sometimes found myself glancing at my partner's work which means that I was learning absolutely nothing.

Next time I will make sure to fully read the task as I got a bit muddled up on some exercises. Lastly, I need to be more patient because I got frustrated to easily which really limited my learning.
